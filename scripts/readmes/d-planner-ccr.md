# LSP D-Planner + CCR

**Rebreather edition** of [LSP D-Planner](https://github.com/Three-Cats-LSP/LSP_D-planner) — full closed-circuit (CCR), passive SCR (pSCR), bailout, and descent setpoint planning on top of the v2.20.x open-circuit foundation.

This is a **separate product and repository**. The main [LSP D-Planner](https://github.com/Three-Cats-LSP/LSP_D-planner) stays on the stable open-circuit release line (v2.20.x) without rebreather code.

Part of the [Three Cats LSP](https://threecats-lsp.com) **Diver's Toolkit**.

🌐 **Live App (GitHub Pages)**: https://three-cats-lsp.github.io/LSP_D-planner-CCR/

**Current version: 2.30.0**

## What's different from LSP D-Planner?

Built from LSP D-Planner **v2.20.21** with rebreather-specific additions only in this repo:

- **CCR (closed circuit)** — diluent-aware tissue loading, setpoint crossing, loop vs OC deco gas logic
- **pSCR (passive SCR)** — GUE-style O₂ drop model
- **Bailout mode** — OC ascent with GF 90/90 (Bühlmann)
- **Descent setpoint** — default 0.7 bar until high setpoint depth
- Both **Bühlmann ZH-L16C + GF** and **VPM-B / VPM-B/GFS** engines

All other features (Surf GF, prior-dive O₂ carry, shallow gradient, export/banner, presets, etc.) match the v2.20.x base.

## Development

Same single-file architecture as LSP D-Planner — primary code in `index.html`.

```bash
python audit.py index.html    # 271 checks (includes GROUP 41 CCR)
```

Test suites: `tests-verify.html` (Section I · CCR), `tests-massive.html` (T3-CCR MultiDeco cross-val).
