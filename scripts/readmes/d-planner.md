# LSP D-Planner

Free open-source decompression planner for recreational and technical divers. Runs entirely in the browser — no install, no build step, no server, no account.

Part of the [Three Cats LSP](https://threecats-lsp.com) **Diver's Toolkit**.

🌐 **Live app:** https://threecats-lsp.com/d-planner/  
📲 **Android APK:** https://threecats-lsp.com/d-planner/download.html  

**Current version: 2.20.32**

> **Looking for rebreather planning?** See [LSP D-Planner + CCR](https://github.com/Three-Cats-LSP/LSP_D-planner-CCR) — CCR, pSCR, bailout on Bühlmann + VPM-B.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Bühlmann ZHL-16C + GF** | 16 tissue compartments. GF Low/High via presets (GUE, MultiDeco, Abysner, Subsurface, DiveKit) or custom. Shallow gradient toggle. |
| **VPM-B** | Varying Permeability Model — bubble nuclei tracking. Conservatism +0 to +5. |
| **VPM-B/GFS** | VPM-B deep stops + GF High applied at shallow stops. |
| **PADI RDP** | Recreational NDL tables with pressure group tracking (Rec mode). |

## Features

### Recreational Mode
- NDL tables (PADI RDP-based + Bühlmann) with GF-adjustable limits
- Multi-dive day planning with residual nitrogen tracking across up to 4 dives
- Surface interval calculator — compartment tissue loading, controlling compartment, reverse-profile warning
- Average depth converter

### Technical Mode
- Full trimix entry (O₂ / He / N₂) for bottom gas and all deco gases
- Travel gas card with auto-switch depth by MOD
- Altitude support — surface pressure presets to 3000 m, acclimatization toggle
- Repetitive dive tissue carry (ZHL + VPM)
- Contingency plans — extended bottom time, went deeper (+3 m / +5 m)
- Surface GF footer metric

### Gas Management
- Gas consumption card — total volume, rule of thirds / half tank, turn pressure, reserve, sufficiency
- Up to 2 deco gas cards + travel gas (metric and imperial)
- SAC-based consumption in litres or cubic feet

### Tools
- **MOD Calculator** — ppO₂ limits, altitude-aware
- **Best Mix** — optimal O₂% for target depth and ppO₂
- **END Calculator** — narcotic equivalent depth
- **EAD Table** — nitrox EAD at common depths
- **Gas Table** — ppO₂, EAD, MOD for common mixes
- **Unit Converter** — depth, pressure, volume, SAC rate
- **CNS / OTU Tracker** — standalone oxygen toxicity calculator
